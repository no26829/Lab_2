**The log**

**Week 1:** We discussed the Lab and developed an understanding of what we needed to do. We discussed many ideas but, unfortunately we did not come to an agreement on what problem we would attempt to paralellise. Some of the problems we considered included approximating pi numerically, character/string analysis within texts, concatenation of large matrix multiplications and using different methods to solve systems of linear equations.

**Week 2:** We organised a system of communication between the group members and Naima set up the Git account for us to upload to. After much deliberation we decided to attempt to paralellise the travelling salesman problem.
